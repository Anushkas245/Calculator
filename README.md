# Calculator MVC App - C# Project

This is a simple Calculator application developed using C# and ASP.NET MVC framework.  
It provides basic arithmetic operations with a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Project Design and Features
This calculator project is not just functional but also thoughtfully designed with a clean and intuitive user interface created entirely through C# Windows Forms code. Every button, from numbers to operators, has been dynamically created and positioned programmatically, showcasing the power and flexibility of Windows Forms.

### Key Design Highlights:
- **Dynamic Button Creation:** All number buttons (0-9), operator buttons (+, -, *, /), and functional buttons (Equals, Clear) are created and arranged via code, ensuring a consistent and maintainable UI.
- **Responsive Display:** The display textbox updates in real-time, showing the current input or result, and handles input validation gracefully.
- **Simple and User-Friendly Layout:** Buttons are arranged logically for ease of use, mimicking standard calculators to provide an intuitive experience.
- **Robust Error Handling:** The app checks for invalid inputs (like dividing by zero) and notifies users with clear error messages.

This project is a great demonstration of how to build a fully functional desktop calculator with a polished look and solid user experience using just C# code, making it perfect for beginners who want to learn Windows Forms development or anyone interested in desktop app UI design.
